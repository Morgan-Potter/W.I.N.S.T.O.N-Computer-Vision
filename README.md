# W.I.N.S.T.O.N The Robot Dog Computer Vision

Well this repo is kind of in heavy development so most things will not make sense to everyone who isnt me. Basically, I captured the images with the capture-images.py file, I created a live sobel filter display in main.py (not really the main file), I had chatgpt write code in triangulation.py, and I am doing block matching in block-match.py (currently the main file I am working on).
